# CS-300 Portfolio

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem being solved in the projects for this course was which data structure would be most efficient for a given task. Specifically, the comparison centered on vectors, hash tables and binary search trees. 

## How did you approach the problem?
My approach to any problem begins with research. Any problem in coding is best addressed from the outset by examining the elements of the problem. For instance, with a data structure for storage, you need to quantify the features of each solution around time and space complexity, where time focuses on the runtime of the code, and space complexity centers on hardware needs like ram and storage.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I can't really say that I encountered any roadblocks during these assignments. I have prior experience with most of the concepts, so any minor hiccups I did encounter, I pretty much already knew how to address it.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It's expanded my approach by bringing to light the question of optimization. Any of the data structures used in the course suffice for the task, but not every task is that clear cut. When working with a system of any complexity, it's important to drill down the basic fundamental resource cost of any given solution. Now, that drilldown may not change what you ultimately decide to do, but it does help inform ways you can improve in the future given current operating expenditures.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
It's evolved the way I operate in much the same way as any coding experience does. I learn new tools to take away to other problems, be they other university problems, or just problems I encounter in my day-to-day or personal projects for utilities I make. All-in-all, I'm leaving this course with a new paradigm of consideration as I code.
